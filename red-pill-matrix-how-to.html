<p>Questioning myself if everything is subjective then basically nothing exists. 
If every person is lowkey hypocritical anyway (you say sugar is bad for you but a moment later you drink lipton or any drink from a near shop which obviouly can have some amount of sugar in it) then there is no point in using the word hypocrisy at all.</p> 

<p>If the following principle can be attributed to any other concept such as knowledge, skill, how smart you are, language usage, opinions, maybe even social boundaries just become void.</p>

</p>This made me question what really is this world because nothing here is honest and truth are lies that are "true" and the way parents taught you doesnt matter because they told lies that were tweaked to their subjective views that may be true or perhaps not but *infinitely stem from something back to 1100s*...</p>

<p>This sounds like bs explaining basic ways society functions yet there are benifits of this too, just like there's benifits out of everything, *even in getting rejected by a record label means youll find a one that better suites you + more spare time yay.. and free of their rules and a lot of other things to be picked subjectively* </p>

<p>The only one who matters there is you, though it can fun to mess around with this, very deep knowledge on how this world functions yet .. oh yeah </p>

<p>A bad guy really is the bad guy because he is labeled as "bad guy" by people. Having this belief just corrupts your mind and that nothing in social interractions is clear and if you want to completely ruin your social abilities you can do so by</p>

<p>1. Identifying how the person X affected you with the action Y at the time Z and dig a bit deeper on what that action Y done to you and why at the time Z, slowly move the wondering from time X to what could happen if it was a second later than at the time Z.</p>

<p>2. Keep the wondering process while slowly shifting the XYZ impacters to anything, the person X could be someone else you know and did the different action than Y.</p>

<p>3. Over a bit of wondering increase the impacters from XYZ to ABCDEFGH or as many as you can, if the person X did the action Y with the book or hammer or keyboard or .. pretty much any tool; while being sick with flu (that minorly changed the output by being slower perhaps)</p>

<p>4. Keep the wondering further until the entire life starts projecting as a never ending fractal in front of you, slowly nothing will matter and you are now capable of seeing through things, how the melatonin pills can be a scam and do nothing, how they can sell you a computer keyboard or a coffee while intentionally raising the price to profit more, how they can throw in some silent manipulations via social media algorithms, how Google is a massive giant impossible to escape; strategy for how your content looks in search is being controlled by them; {real life is deeply connected to the web in 2020s} they hold you on a string.
